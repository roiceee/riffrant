Functionalities:
1. Users have the ability to express their opinions on the platform, but this is limited to a certain number of posts to mitigate the risk of post flooding or spamming.
2. Users can access their own profiles but are restricted to viewing only their posts. They are prohibited from posting on their own profiles.
3. The application will implement hash mapping for the spam tracker. Users who exceed the daily quota for posting and are identified as spammers will be temporarily barred from posting for a specified number of days or hours.
4. Users have the option to delete their posts if they choose to do so. These posts will also be automatically removed from their profile view.
5. Administrators have the authority to block and delete the accounts of users who violate the guidelines and agreements of the application.
6. Commenting on posts is an optional feature.

Specific numbers for post limits and suspension durations are defined according to our application's requirements and policies.
